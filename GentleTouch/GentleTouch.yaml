  You need to configure patterns and triggers before it will work, 
  open the configuration window to do that.  
  
  For DualSense/Shock4 support, the controller needs to be connected wired (same as the game's)
  and there can only be one of a type connected (e.g., only one DualSense, not two).
  
  Currently supported triggers are:
  - Cooldowns
  - Near Aether Current

punchline: Create vibration patterns for the controller and specify triggers to make it vibrate.
